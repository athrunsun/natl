Why I cannot find screenshot on the result page?
</#macro>

<#macro qanswer>
<p>In order to enable the executor to take screenshot upon any failures, we need to add one piece of code into your @BeforeClass method of your base test class.</p> 
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
@BeforeClass(alwaysRun = true)
public void assignDriverToScreenshotListener(ITestContext context) {
    final String DRIVER_ATTR = "driver";
    context.setAttribute(DRIVER_ATTR + Thread.currentThread().getId(), 
        this.driver);
}
</pre></p>
<p>Notice that we are assigning <a class="code">this.driver</a> to the TestNG test context. 
That means, we will take screenshot with the driver being passed. 
Sometimes, we will create multiple driver instances within one test case. 
In that case we would require you to assign the "latest" driver instance again, to the <a class="code">ITestContext</a>.</p>
