Do we support TestNG "Depends on" annotation?
</#macro>

<#macro qanswer>
<p>No. Only the target method will be executed - and final execution status will be skipped.</p>
<p>As a test design best practice, we recommend you not add any dependency to your test cases. 
You can explicitly call the dependent methods if you have to.</p>
