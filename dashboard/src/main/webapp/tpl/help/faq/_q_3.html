What if each slave requires a unique login user account?
</#macro>

<#macro qanswer>
<p>Yes. There are possibilities that we would like each test slave have a unique value during testing. 
For example, some products only allow one user logged in from one IP.</p>

<p>In this case, NATL provides flexibility to get its unique ID of each slave, which can be read by the code at run time. 
Here is the steps to introduce the unique ID:</p>

<p>First, it's pretty easy to read the value:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
public int getSlaveId(int maxNum) {
    int pointer = 0;
<a class="fg-black">    String NATL_QUEUE_INDEX = "nitrogen_atl_entryindex";
    String pointerIndex = System.getProperty(NATL_QUEUE_INDEX);</a>
    
    if (pointerIndex == null || pointerIndex.isEmpty()) {
        // make sure no exception thrown here. Keep default as 0;
    }
    else {
        pointer = Integer.parseInt(pointerIndex);
    }
    return pointer % maxNum; // Pointer is always smaller than maxNum.
    // Or, you can return pointer directly if there is no such maxNum.
}</pre></p>

<p>That system property <a class="code">nitrogen_atl_entryindex</a> is numbered by NATL for each test slave. 
The possible value would be [1, n], where n is the total slave numbers.
With that, you can fetch your unique value from lists defined in your project.</p>
